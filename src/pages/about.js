  article: {
    quote: `"By embracing HonestyMeter, you can join the vanguard of a movement that
    champions media objectivity and transparency. The more people who adopt this tool,
    the more we can create a well-informed society where the truth prevails over bias and misinformation"`,

  introduction: {
    title: 'Introduction:',
    joke: `The simplest way to illustrate what HonestyMeter addresses can be demonstrated through this joke:

    Upon his arrival in Paris, a reporter asks the Pope for his opinion on the city's famous bordellos.
     Surprised by the question, the Pope responds, "Are there bordellos in Paris?" 
     The next day, the headline in the newspapers reads: "The Pope's First Question Upon Arrival in Paris: Are There Bordellos in Paris?"...
    
    Although the facts presented are 100% true, the way they are reported is 100% misleading.
    Even if the article provides full context, most readers read only headlines and will never know the truth.`,

    problem: `In today's world, media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing decision-making processes.
     However, the proliferation of fake news and misinformation has significantly blurred the lines between fact and fiction, 
     and between objective and biased reporting. This challenge is intensified by the use of sophisticated, yet subtle,
      manipulative techniques. Techniques such as sensationalism, framing, and selective reporting, among multiple others,
       are commonly employed by media outlets. These tactics can lead audiences to form distorted perceptions of reality, 
       hindering their ability to make well-informed decisions.`,

    problemNote: `It's important to emphasize that manipulative reporting is a much more dangerous phenomenon than fake news.
     False facts can usually be easily detected, and authoritative sources conduct thorough fact-checking
      before publishing any content, as publishing false facts leads to immediate accountability.

    Consuming news from credible sources can almost fully protect people from fake news. However,
     when content is published by an authoritative source and all the facts are real, but are presented 
     using sophisticated hidden manipulation techniques, it can dramatically distort the perception of these facts.
      This distortion can often lead the audience to understand the absolute opposite of the truth,
       and yet the source often faces zero accountability!    

    This terrible phenomenon gravely jeopardizes the very basis of freedom and democracy.`,

    solution: `To address this issue, we have developed the HonestyMeter framework â€“ a free,
     AI-powered tool designed to assess the objectivity and bias of media content. 
     Utilizing neural networks and advanced language models, HonestyMeter meticulously analyzes various media elements 
     to identify potential manipulative tactics. It generates a comprehensive objectivity report, which includes an objectivity score,
      a list of detected manipulations, and recommendations for mitigating bias within the text.
      Wide adoption of HonestyMeter is capable of enhancing media transparency and objectivity worldwide,
       empowering authors to craft more objective content and enabling audiences to make better-informed decisions.`,

    title: 'Important Considerations When Using the HonestyMeter Framework:',

    p1: `When using the tool for the first time, you may be shocked by the high levels
    of subjectivity even in the content of the most well-known and authoritative mass media sources.
    It is essential to acknowledge that no one can be entirely objective, and some degree of bias is inevitable.
    Furthermore, a low objectivity score does not necessarily indicate malicious intent on the part of the mass
    media or journalists. Many instances of biased content are created unknowingly, with the best of intentions.`,

    p2: `Our goal is not to blame anyone, but to provide a valuable tool for content creators and consumers
    alike that can help improve objectivity in media content. By using the HonestyMeter framework thoughtfully
    and with an understanding of its limitations, we can take a step towards creating a more reliable and
    trustworthy source of information for all.`,

          <h2>Technical Challenges and Solutions</h2>
          <p>The current version of HonestyMeter is an experimental demo.
            There is significant room for improvement in terms of the depth, accuracy, and consistency of the reports, for the following reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The GPT-3.5-Turbo model was used in production until the end of December 2023 to minimize costs,
              as the tool is free and self-funded. At the end of December 2023, we switched to GPT-4,
              reducing the daily report count as an experiment to prioritize quality over quantity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Large Language Models (LLMs) may face challenges in maintaining context in extended texts.
            </li>
            <li>
              In tasks that are complex and multi-stepped, LLMs tend to be less efficient, especially with lengthy inputs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Therefore, we are actively developing more sophisticated, multi-staged algorithms to significantly enhance the reliability and consistency of evaluations.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, even in its current state, HonestyMeter frequently provides valuable insights that are challenging for humans to detect.</p>

          <p><strong>To enhance the results, we are undertaking the following steps,
            which are part of ongoing research and have not yet been implemented in production.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We conducted in-depth research on manipulation techniques, gaining a
              comprehensive understanding of manipulation categories. We revised the list
              of manipulations and created a more concise and well-structured list that covers
              all manipulation groups without redundancy or omissions.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>We are moving away from our initial approach of relying on the LLM&apos;s &quot;magic&quot; with broad instructions,
              which was intended to prove the concept and showcase its potential. We are now working on providing the LLM with thorough,
              step-by-step instructions for detecting each manipulation technique.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              We broke down the evaluation process into the smallest possible tasks.
              We are currently testing distinct services for each micro-step, which involve chains of prompts,
              autonomous agents and individual models that are specifically trained
              and fine-tuned for certain tasks. This approach is anticipated to not only improve output consistency
              but also reduce the system&apos;s dependence on any single model and simplify the process of replacing
              existing models with better or more cost-effective open-source alternatives when necessary.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              We are experimenting with the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs)
              and closely monitoring their exponential progress.
              By incorporating upcoming, newly released advanced models into our workflow,
              we expect to achieve significant enhancements in each component of our system,
              thereby leading to an overall elevation in performance.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              We have planned the release of seven versions of the app, each building upon the previous one
              and gradually incorporating more complex techniques for detecting manipulation.
              The first MVP version focuses on the most common and easily detectable manipulation techniques,
              providing a solid indication of bias levels. Every subsequent version builds upon this foundation,
              gradually adding more complex techniques for detection. The last three versions focus on the most
              advanced and complex techniques, offering the most detailed and thorough analysis of bias.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="bold"><b>Accuracy, consistency, and deterministic outputs.</b></span></p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s important to note that as long as the system correctly identifies the broad objective or biased nature of an article in most cases,
            it can provide statistically valuable insights into bias levels, even if report accuracy and consistency are not perfect.
            This can be achieved by analyzing large volumes of content and calculating average scores from multiple iterations over the same articles.          </p>
          <p>For instance, by analyzing multiple articles from several sources
            and repeating the analysis of each article multiple times, we can identify
            which sources are more or less biased relative to each other.
            This approach, even with relatively low analysis accuracy, can yield statistically high confidence in the results.
          </p>
          <p>Consequently, the effectiveness of the system isn&apos;t a binary choice between perfect operation and complete failure.
            It involves attaining a minimum required level of performance, followed by gradual improvements towards maximum effectiveness.</p>
          <p>
            We are optimistic that through ongoing research and development,
            the efficiency and capabilities of HonestyMeter will steadily improve,
            gradually approaching its maximum potential. Even now, in its experimental demo phase,
            HonestyMeter frequently provides insights that are difficult for humans to discern.
