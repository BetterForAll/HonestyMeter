    quote: `"By embracing HonestyMeter, you can join the vanguard of a movement that
    champions media objectivity and transparency. The more people who adopt this tool,
    the more we can create a well-informed society where the truth prevails over bias and misinformation"`,

  introduction: {
    title: 'Introduction:',
    joke: `The simplest way to illustrate what HonestyMeter addresses can be demonstrated through this joke:

    Upon his arrival in Paris, a reporter asks the Pope for his opinion on the city's famous bordellos.
     Surprised by the question, the Pope responds, "Are there bordellos in Paris?" 
     The next day, the headline in the newspapers reads: "The Pope's First Question Upon Arrival in Paris: Are There Bordellos in Paris?"...
    
    Although the facts presented are 100% true, the way they are reported is 100% misleading.
    Even if the article provides full context, most readers read only headlines and will never know the truth.`,

    problem: `In today's world, media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing decision-making es.
     However, the proliferation of fake news and misinformation has significantly blurred the lines between fact and fiction, 
     and between objective and biased reporting. This challenge is intensified by the use of sophisticated, yet subtle,
      manipulative techniques. Techniques such as sensationalism, framing, and selective reporting, among multiple others,
       are commonly employed by media outlets. These tactics can lead audiences to form distorted perceptions of reality, 
       hindering their ability to make well-informed decisions.`,

    problemNote: `It's important to emphasize that manipulative reporting is a much more dangerous phenomenon than fake news.
     False facts can usually be easily detected, and authoritative sources conduct thorough fact-checking
      before publishing any content, as publishing false facts leads to immediate accountability.

    Consuming news from credible sources can almost fully protect people from fake news. However,
     when content is published by an authoritative source and all the facts are real, but are presented 
     using sophisticated hidden manipulation techniques, it can dramatically distort the perception of these facts.
      This distortion can often lead the audience to understand the absolute opposite of the truth,
       and yet the source often faces zero accountability!    

    This terrible phenomenon gravely jeopardizes the very basis of freedom and democracy.`,

    solution: `To address this issue, we have developed the HonestyMeter framework â€“ a free,
     AI-powered tool designed to assess the objectivity and bias of media content. 
     Utilizing neural networks and advanced language models, HonestyMeter meticulously analyzes various media elements 
     to identify potential manipulative tactics. It generates a comprehensive objectivity report, which includes an objectivity score,
      a list of detected manipulations, and recommendations for mitigating bias within the text.
      Wide adoption of HonestyMeter is capable of enhancing media transparency and objectivity worldwide,
       empowering authors to craft more objective content and enabling audiences to make better-informed decisions.`,

    title: 'Important Considerations When Using the HonestyMeter Framework:',

    p1: `When using the tool for the first time, you may be shocked by the high levels
    of subjectivity even in the content of the most well-known and authoritative mass media sources.
    It is essential to acknowledge that no one can be entirely objective, and some degree of bias is inevitable.
    Furthermore, a low objectivity score does not necessarily indicate malicious intent on the part of the mass
    media or journalists. Many instances of biased content are created unknowingly, with the best of intentions.`,

    p2: `Our goal is not to blame anyone, but to provide a valuable tool for content creators and consumers
    alike that can help improve objectivity in media content. By using the HonestyMeter framework thoughtfully
    and with an understanding of its limitations, we can take a step towards creating a more reliable and
    trustworthy source of information for all.`,

          <h2>Technical Challenges and Solutions</h2>
          <p>The current version of HonestyMeter is an experimental demo.
            There is significant room for improvement in terms of the depth, accuracy, and consistency of the reports, for the following reasons:</p>
          <ul style={STYLES.list}>
            <li>
              The GPT-3.5-Turbo model was used in production until the end of December 2023 to minimize costs,
              as the tool is free and self-funded. At the end of December 2023, we switched to GPT-4,
              reducing the daily report count as an experiment to prioritize quality over quantity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Large Language Models (LLMs) may face challenges in maintaining context in extended texts.
            </li>
            <li>
              In tasks that are complex and multi-stepped, LLMs tend to be less efficient, especially with lengthy inputs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Therefore, we are actively developing more sophisticated, multi-staged algorithms to significantly enhance the reliability and consistency of evaluations.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, even in its current state, HonestyMeter frequently provides valuable insights that are challenging for humans to detect.</p>

          <p><strong>To enhance the results, we are undertaking the following steps.
            which are part of ongoing research and have not yet been fully implemented in production.</strong></p>
          <ul style={STYLES.list}>
            <li>We conducted in-depth research on manipulation techniques, gaining a
              comprehensive understanding of manipulation categories. We revised the list
              of manipulations and created a more concise and well-structured list that covers
              all manipulation groups without redundancy or omissions.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>We are moving away from our initial approach of relying on the LLM&apos;s &quot;magic&quot; with broad instructions,
              which was intended to prove the concept and showcase its potential. We are now working on providing the LLM with thorough,
              step-by-step instructions for detecting each manipulation technique.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              We broke down the evaluation process into the smallest possible tasks.
              We are currently testing distinct services for each micro-step, which involve chains of prompts,
              autonomous agents and individual models that are specifically trained
              and fine-tuned for certain tasks. This approach is anticipated to not only improve output consistency
              but also reduce the system&apos;s dependence on any single model and simplify the process of replacing
              existing models with better or more cost-effective open-source alternatives when necessary.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              We are experimenting with the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs)
              and closely monitoring their exponential progress.
              By incorporating upcoming, newly released advanced models into our workflow,
              we expect to achieve significant enhancements in each component of our system,
              thereby leading to an overall elevation in performance.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              We have planned the release of seven versions of the app, each building upon the previous one
              and gradually incorporating more complex techniques for detecting manipulation.
              The first MVP version focuses on the most common and easily detectable manipulation techniques,
              providing a solid indication of bias levels. Every subsequent version builds upon this foundation,
              gradually adding more complex techniques for detection. The last three versions focus on the most
              advanced and complex techniques, offering the most detailed and thorough analysis of bias.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              We have added a user feedback feature. Unlike all the features listed above, this one is already released.
              User feedback is utilized to enhance our bias reports and to train our future models,
              turning our system into a continuously self-improving entity.

              <h3>Feedback-Based Optimization Loop:</h3>
              <ul style={STYLES.list}>
                <li>A user who views the bias report clicks on the section that, in their opinion, should be changed.</li>
                <li>The user leaves feedback, explaining the suggested changes.</li>
                <li>The feedback is reviewed by a Large Language Model (LLM), following strict rules.
                  To make only justified changes that improve or fix inaccuracies.
                </li>
                <li>If the feedback is accepted:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The LLM updates the original report.</li>
                    <li>The updated report is saved and used in the training dataset.</li>
                    <li>The LLM is periodically retrained using the updated dataset.Resulting in constant improvement.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <p>It&apos;s important to note that even with the current simplified experimental evaluation method, focused user feedback can lead to a more efficient revision of the report by AI.
                  Presently, the task of creating the initial report is extremely challenging for LLMs, as it requires multi-step reasoning with large contexts.</p>
                <p>
                  However, if a user points out a very specific issue that should be reevaluated, it makes the task much easier, significantly increasing the evaluation&apos;s efficiency.
                  If, as a result of user feedback, the report is amended by the LLM, it means that the specific part highlighted by the user is now more accurate than it initially was.
                  Therefore, the revised report will be included in the training dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adhering to this approach of user feedback, LLM reevaluation, and training dataset enrichment empowers the system to autonomously enhance its capabilities,
                  even without adopting the other upgrades listed above.
                </p>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="bold"><b>Accuracy, consistency, and deterministic outputs.</b></span></p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s important to note that as long as the system correctly identifies the broad objective or manipulative nature of an article in most cases,
            it can provide statistically valuable insights into bias and manipulation levels, even if report accuracy and consistency are not perfect.
            This can be achieved by analyzing large volumes of content and calculating average scores from multiple iterations over the same articles.          </p>
          <p>For instance, by analyzing multiple articles from several sources
            and repeating the analysis of each article multiple times, we can identify
            which sources are more or less biased relative to each other.
            This approach, even with relatively low analysis accuracy, can yield statistically high confidence in the results.
          </p>
          <p>Consequently, the effectiveness of the system isn&apos;t a binary choice between perfect operation and complete failure.
            It involves attaining a minimum required level of performance, followed by gradual improvements towards maximum effectiveness.</p>
          <p>
            We are optimistic that through ongoing research and development,
            the efficiency and capabilities of HonestyMeter will steadily improve,
            gradually approaching its maximum potential. Even now, in its experimental demo phase,
            HonestyMeter frequently provides insights that are difficult for humans to discern.

        <h2>Monetization in Harmony with Free and Transparent Media Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          Our main goal is to provide free, objective analysis based on a publicly open and transparent methodology.
          Currently, we self-fund the project by investing our own time and money, while offering it completely free of charge.
          We have received reasonable feedback from some users who noted that attracting
          additional funds could significantly aid in advancing the development and creating mass adoption.
          However, attracting substantial funds for a free service, based solely on social impact,
          without monetizing it and without offering any profit potential to investors, may prove challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we have created a list of possible monetization strategies that
          can work while fully retaining our vision of a free, open framework that
          makes the media more truthful and transparent.
          Implementing these strategies may help us in two ways:
          funding the project independently and attracting additional investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          This list includes innovative products with unique commercial value,
          capitalizing on our core functionality. These products are targeting
          rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar markets, where even a minuscule
          market share could yield multimillion-dollar revenues.

              Core Project and Data Service Details
            </h3>

            <p>
              Currently, the system is divided into two main parts:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. The Core Project: This is a free tool that enables anyone to evaluate content for bias.
              It is self-funded, self-maintained, and open-source, designed to make unbiased content analysis accessible to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Data Collection Service (Separate Private Entity): This service includes tools that scan news, create,
              and save reports to our databases using our core report creation mechanism.
              These reports enhance the general news integrity feed on the homepage and contribute to
              a popular people integrity feed on the people page. In addition, these services generate
              periodic ratings for the most praised and criticized individuals, as well as for the most
              objective sources, using openly explained methodology.
            </p>

            <p>
              Initially, we populated the database by manually using our main app, just as anyone else could.
              However, we later developed an automated service for this task that uses the same evaluation logic.
              It required purely backend logic that didn&apos;t fit into the serverless environment on which our app is currently running.
              Therefore we deployed it as a separate service.
              Recently, we realized that having a separate service capable of gathering large amounts of data,
              enabling complex aggregations and data analysis, is not only convenient for updating our website
              but also opens up potential avenues for future monetization opportunities.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Other services and products based on HonestyMeter core technology</b><br /><br />
            Honest News Portal: A subscription-based objective news service where the news is
            rewritten to present only neutral facts without bias or opinions.<br /><br />
            Premium Features: Custom report and advanced database search for commercial use.<br /><br />
            Additional Services: Including Email and Chat Analysis, Rewriting Service for
            Enhanced Objectivity, Video and Voice Meeting Analysis, and Chrome Extension
            as a Freemium bias analysis report generator.<br /><br />
            Market Potential: Multi-billion dollar potential in fields like digital
            marketing, journalism, academic research, corporate communications, and
            content verification.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Monetization Strategies Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The brief overview of monetization options illustrates the
          feasibility of combining free bias detection and a transparent methodology
          with various monetization options that hold significant potential. This
          combination enhances both the utility and financial viability of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to emphasize that all potential monetization strategies listed above
          are meant to increase the chances of sustaining and expanding
          the system. Despite that, our main objective remains a FREE and OPEN framework.
          If it&apos;s possible to sustain the project and provide all services listed above completely for FREE FOREVER,
          we definitely prefer to keep it this way. If you have any ideas on how this can be achieved,
          we&apos;d be thankful for you sharing them with us.
          Your opinion is important to us. If you have any feedback on this matter, feel free to contact us and share your thoughts.
